Simple application to read current clocks of ATi Radeon cards (xf86-video-ati, xf86-video-amdgpu and fglrx).

# xf86-video-ati and xf86-video-amdgpu  driver
Install and run radeon-profile-daemon (https://github.com/marazmista/radeon-profile-daemon) for using this app as normal user. Otherwise app need to be run with root privilages for read clocks and changing profiles. You can add `username ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/radeon-profile` to your `/etc/sudoers`. Here is tip for run app as normal user but involves change permissions to system files: http://bit.ly/1dvQMhS

Fan control is available only on Radeon HD 7000 series and above.

Can be forced by `--driver xorg` parameter.

# fglrx driver
Normal user can run it. Data is read from `ati-config` output. No support for power settings.

Can be forced by `--driver fglrx` parameter.

# Dependencies
Crucial:
* Qt4 or Qt5  (see build below)
* libxrandr
* libdrm
* radeon card

For full functionality:
* glxinfo - info about OpenGL, mesa
* xdriinfo - driver info
* xrandr - connected displays
* lm_sensors - temperature (no need if hwmon for card is present in sysfs and if catalyst is installed)

# Build
Qt4: `qmake-qt4 && make` in source directory.

Qt5: `qmake && make` in source directory.

# Troubleshooting
* __"no values":__ Check `/sys/kernel/debug`. If it's empty, try `# mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug`
